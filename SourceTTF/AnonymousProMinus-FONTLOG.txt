FONTLOG for Anonymous Pro

This file provides detailed information on the Anonymous Pro Minus Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Anonymous Pro Minus fonts and any derivative works.

Anonymous Pro Minus is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed especially with coding in mind. Characters that could be mistaken for one another (O, 0, I, l, 1, etc.) have distinct shapes to make them easier to tell apart in the context of source code.

Anonymous Pro Minus is distributed with the Open Font License (OFL).

For more information, see the file "README.txt".
